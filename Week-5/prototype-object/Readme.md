### Protecting the Object

Create a JavaScript object called person with properties name, age, and email. Implement the following:

Make the name and email properties read-only.
Make the age property write-only.
Add a method called getAge() that returns the age property.
Add a method called setAge() that accepts an age parameter and updates the age property.

### JavaScript Prototype

Create a JavaScript object called Vehicle with properties make, model, and year. Implement the following:

Add a method called getDetails() that returns a string with the vehicle's make, model, and year.
Create a subclass called Car that extends Vehicle with an additional property numDoors.
Override the getDetails() method in Car to include the number of doors in the string that is returned.
Create an instance of Vehicle and an instance of Car, and call the getDetails() method on each instance, logging the result to the console.

### Desired Coding Practices:

Code should be indented properly.
Code should be readable.
Code should handle any edge cases foreseen.
Add comments wherever required.
Follow meaningful naming conventions, avoid generic naming conventions such as a,b,c,x,y,z etc.
